# Edopro Custom Cards by Reflexxion

Welcome to my Edopro Custom Card repository. My idea is to create new archetypes with mechanics that are new or rarely used in the current format.

(I do not own all the artworks of the cards.)

## How to install?

The easiest way to install the custom card package to your EDOPro Programm is to download this <a href="https://github.com/lakevin/EdoProCustom/blob/assets/assets/user_configs.json">user_configs.json</a>.

Move this file to the config folder of your EDOPro installation (e.g. <YOUR PATH>/ProjectIgnis/config). <b>Attention</b>: If you already have this file in this folder, other configurations will be overwritten.

In this case you can edit the existing file. Search the line that starts with ```"repos": [``` and insert the following code directly below it:

```
{
   "url": "https://github.com/lakevin/EdoProCustom",
   "repo_name": "Reflexxion Cards",
   "should_update": true,
   "should_read": true
},
```

If you need any help, you can contact me on my Discord server (link above).

### Planned Archetypes

1. Demon Mask: This archetype is based on the "Masks" cards from the first anime season. The new "Demon Mask" cards take control of opponent monsters and use them for Fusion Summons.
2. Majestal: It takes the mechanics of the "Crystal Beast" archetype and applies them in a more modern and competitive way. It will be a Fusion Summon focused archetype.
3. Shimmerbane/Diamonshard: The competing deck to the "Majestal" deck theme. It redefines the trap monster mechanic and uses mainly Synchro Summon.
