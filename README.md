# Edopro Custom Cards by Reflexxion

Welcome to my Edopro Custom Card repository. My idea is to create new archetypes with mechanics that are new or rarely used in the current format.

(I do not own all the artworks of the cards.)

## Planned Updates

### November / December 2023

- Hi-Tech: Is a new Synchro-based archetype that uses Synchro Monsters from the Extra Deck as material. The Synchro Monsters activate their effect when they are used as Synchro material.

### Later:

- Demon Mask: This archetype is based on the "Masks" cards from the first anime season. The new "Demon Mask" cards take control of opponent monsters and use them for Fusion Summons.
- Timekeeper / Time Traveler: This archetype has cards that work like a lighter version of <a href="https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12074">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>. It can disrupt your opponent by interrupting effects and banishing cards.
